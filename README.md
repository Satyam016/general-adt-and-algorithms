# general-adt
These code are ment only for learning purpose.
The user can download the code and modify code according to their use.

Some files have versions written with them -
  This is to imply that the codes are in construction period.
  Users can use any version and then modify it according to their need.

The repository also has some general algorithms and some of their implementation. It gives a raw idea that a given algorithm can be modified for user benefit. These codes encourage the user to midify them and try new approaches.

Note - Binary search algorithms require the array to be sorted.

It also contains some sorting algorithms. These can be used indirectly to solve other problems and are henceforth necessary to be mentioned.

Code for hashing using open chain uses mod function for mapping keys. User can change hash_function to uses whatever hashing they want to use. This is simply the simplest approach for getting key value.
