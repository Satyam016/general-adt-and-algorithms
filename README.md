# general-adt
These code are ment only for learning purpose.
The user can download the code and modify code according to their use.

Some files have versions written with them -
  This is to imply that the codes are in construction period.
  Users can use any version and then modify it according to their need.

The repository also has some general algorithms and some of their implementation. It gives a raw idea that a given algorithm can be modified for user benefit. These codes encourage the user to midify them and try new approaches.

Note - Binary search algorithms require the array to be sorted.

It also contains some sorting algorithms. These can be used indirectly to solve other problems and are henceforth necessary to be mentioned.

Code for hashing using open chain uses mod function for mapping keys. User can change hash_function to uses whatever hashing they want to use. This is simply the simplest approach for getting key value.

All hashing codes have the same encryption method. User is free to change the method and good change is welcome.

The repository also contains a game of tick tak toe. user can play it by running it on terminal. The basic moves are based on random function but higher moves works according to algorithm. The users are welcomed to improve the computer's play. you can send me modified codes on my mail id.

version 1.1 of tick tak toe game is a slight modification of the earlier version of game... 
If you are interested in making other strategy games for example chess, contact me on my mail address.

happy coding....
